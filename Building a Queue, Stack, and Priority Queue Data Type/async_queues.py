# Using Asynchronous Queues
# Writing a rudimentary web crawler which recursively follows links on a specified website up to a given depth level and counts the number of visits per link
# To fetch data asynchronously, the popular aiohttp library will be used
# To parse HTML hyperlinks, beautifulsoup4 will be used
# To install both libraries, type this command:
# $ python -m pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4
